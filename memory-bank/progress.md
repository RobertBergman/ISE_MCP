# Project Progress

## What Works

- **Migration to `fastmcp`:** The server uses the `fastmcp` library for MCP implementation.
- **Modular Architecture:** The server has been restructured into a modular package with clear separation of concerns:
  - `config`: Configuration settings and URL definitions
  - `core`: Core models and utility functions
  - `api`: API client for Cisco ISE
  - `tools`: Tool factory for creating MCP tools
  - `__main__`: Command-line entry point with argument parsing
- **Class-Based Design:** Explicit classes have been implemented:
  - `ISEMCPServer`: Encapsulates server logic
  - `ToolFactory`: Creates tool functions from URL definitions
  - `ISEApiClient`: Handles API communication
- **Dynamic Tool Generation:** MCP tools are dynamically generated from `urls.json` by the `ToolFactory`.
- **Asynchronous API Interaction:** Tools make asynchronous GET requests to Cisco ISE using `httpx.AsyncClient` through the `ISEApiClient`.
- **Filtering Capability:**
  - Tool functions accept an optional Pydantic model instance (`params`) which contains `filter_expression` and `query_params`.
  - `pydantic.Field(default_factory=InputModelType)` is used for the `params` argument, allowing clients to call tools without explicit arguments.
- **Dynamic Docstring Generation:** Docstrings are generated with filtering info.
- **Configuration:** Via `urls.json` in multiple possible locations and `.env` (including `ISE_VERIFY_SSL`).
- **Error Handling:** Errors are caught and wrapped in `fastmcp.exceptions.ToolError`. Critical missing environment variables lead to `sys.exit(1)`.
- **Transport Configuration:**
  - Command-line arguments allow customization of transport
  - Default is `streamable-http` for local execution
  - `stdio` transport is used in Docker for Claude Desktop
- **Installable Package:**
  - Added `setup.py` for making the package installable
  - Provides a console script entry point `ise-mcp-server`
- **Testing Framework:**
  - Basic unit tests in the `tests` directory
  - Import verification script
- **Documentation:**
  - Comprehensive docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions
  - Updated README with modular structure details
  - Detailed explanation of each component and its purpose
- **API Response Caching:**
  - Implemented caching using `aiocache` library
  - Added memory-based caching with configurable TTL (default: 5 minutes)
  - Implemented cache key generation based on URL and parameters
  - Added cache hit/miss logging
  - Created three cache management tools: `cache_clear`, `cache_info`, and `cache_config`
  - Added option to bypass cache with `use_cache` parameter
- **Automatic Pagination:**
  - Implemented transparent pagination handling in `ISEApiClient.get()`
  - Added `_get_all_pages()` method to automatically fetch and combine all pages
  - Improved `auto_paginate` parameter (default: True) to control pagination behavior
  - Added caching for both individual pages and complete paginated results
  - Added streaming pagination with `get_stream()` method for large result sets

## Planned Enhancements

Based on our research, we've identified several key enhancements:

### 1. API Response Caching (Implemented)
- **Description:** Implemented caching for API responses to reduce load on Cisco ISE and improve response times
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Used `aiocache` library for async-compatible caching
  - Added caching with time-based expiration (default: 5 minutes)
  - Implemented in-memory caching (with architecture supporting Redis backend)
  - Implemented robust cache key generation based on URL and parameters
  - Added cache hit/miss logging
  - Made caching configurable with three MCP tools:
    - `cache_clear`: Clears cache entries
    - `cache_info`: Gets information about the current cache state
    - `cache_config`: Configures cache settings (enabled/disabled, TTL)
  - Added `use_cache` parameter to bypass cache when needed

### 2. Automatic Pagination Handling (Implemented)
- **Description:** Implemented automatic pagination to handle large result sets transparently
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Added auto-pagination to the ISEApiClient.get() method (default: enabled)
  - Added support for both automatic and manual pagination modes
  - Configured pagination parameters via query_params
  - Implemented caching for both individual pages and complete results
  - Added streaming pagination via get_stream() method
  - Improved error handling to continue with partial results on page failures

### 3. Rate Limiting (Implemented)
- **Description:** Implemented rate limiting to prevent overwhelming the Cisco ISE API
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Used `aiolimiter` library for async-compatible rate limiting
  - Implemented token bucket algorithm with configurable rates
  - Added global rate limit with category-based limits (auth, device, policy)
  - Created URL pattern to category mapping for classification
  - Integrated exponential backoff for rate limit retry handling
  - Added two MCP tools:
    - `rate_limit_info`: Gets information about current rate limiting state
    - `rate_limit_config`: Configures rate limiting settings (enabled/disabled, global limit, category limits)
  - Added safeguards for 429 (Too Many Requests) responses

### 4. Metrics Collection (Planned)
- **Description:** Add metrics collection for monitoring and troubleshooting
- **Implementation Plan:**
  - Use OpenTelemetry with Prometheus backend
  - Collect API operation metrics, cache performance, and system resources
  - Add metrics module for centralized definitions
  - Provide `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus scraping
  - Instrument key methods for metrics collection

### 5. Additional HTTP Methods Support (Planned)
- **Description:** Add support for write operations (POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **Implementation Plan:**
  - Extend ISEApiClient with methods for POST, PUT, DELETE
  - Update URL configuration to specify supported operations
  - Create separate tool functions with appropriate naming
  - Implement CSRF token handling and security best practices
  - Add appropriate input models for write operations

## Current Status

- The codebase has been completely restructured into a modular package with clear separation of concerns.
- The project structure has been simplified by removing the cisco/ISE directory layer, moving ise_mcp_server directly under src/.
- API response caching, automatic pagination handling, and rate limiting have been fully implemented.
- The server can be run in multiple ways:
  - As a module: `python -m src.ise_mcp_server`
  - As an installed package: `ise-mcp-server`
  - With Docker: `docker run -i --rm --env-file=.env ise-mcp:latest`
- Command-line options allow customization of host, port, and transport.
- Fixed Docker startup issues with stdio transport by conditionally passing parameters based on transport type.
- Updated setup.py to use src-layout pattern for Python packaging.
- The code structure follows best practices for software design, making it more maintainable and extensible.
- Additional management tools are available:
  - Cache management: `cache_clear`, `cache_info`, `cache_config`
  - Rate limiting management: `rate_limit_info`, `rate_limit_config`

## Known Issues

- **Incomplete `FilterableFields`:** Same as previously noted.
- **URL Placeholders in `urls.json`:** Same as previously noted; path parameters in URLs are not currently supported by the dynamic tool generation logic.
