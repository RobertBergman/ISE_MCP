# Project Progress

## What Works

- **Migration to `fastmcp`:** The server (`ise_mcp.py`) uses the `fastmcp` library.
- **Dynamic Tool Generation:** MCP tools are dynamically generated from `urls.json`.
- **Asynchronous API Interaction:** Tools make asynchronous GET requests to Cisco ISE using `httpx.AsyncClient`.
- **Filtering Capability (Framework):**
    - Tool functions accept an optional Pydantic model instance (`params`) which contains `filter_expression` and `query_params`.
    - `pydantic.Field(default_factory=InputModelType)` is used for the `params` argument, allowing clients like MCP Inspector to call tools without explicit arguments.
- **Dynamic Docstring Generation:** Docstrings are generated with filtering info.
- **Configuration:** Via `urls.json` and `.env` (including `ISE_VERIFY_SSL`).
- **Error Handling:** `httpx` exceptions (`HTTPStatusError`, `RequestError`) are caught and wrapped in `fastmcp.exceptions.ToolError`. Critical missing environment variables lead to `sys.exit(1)`.
- **`streamable-http` Transport & Async Execution:**
    - The server is configured to run using `streamable-http` transport by default (`await mcp.run_async(transport="streamable-http", ...)`).
    - The main execution logic is asynchronous (`async def _main_async`).
    - `await mcp.get_tools()` is used to fetch the tool count.
- **FastMCP CLI Compatibility:**
    - `mcp.dependencies = []` is set for `fastmcp dev`.
    - `python -m fastmcp dev ...` is used to launch with MCP Inspector.
- **Robust Path Handling:** `pathlib` is used for loading `urls.json`.

## What's Left to Build

- **Accurate `FilterableFields` in `urls.json`:** **CRITICAL USER TASK.** This remains the most significant outstanding item for full usability.
- **Testing:**
    - Thorough testing of tool discovery and calls (with/without filters) against a live Cisco ISE instance using the MCP Inspector (connecting via HTTP to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp` or the configured path).
    - Verification that `default_factory` for tool parameters works as expected when tools are called with no arguments from the Inspector.
- **Advanced Input Schemas (Optional):** Future consideration.
- **Refined Error Handling (Optional):** Future consideration.
- **`requirements.txt` Update:** Needs to be updated to replace `requests` with `httpx`.

## Current Status

- The server code in `ise_mcp.py` has undergone a full code review and incorporates `httpx` for asynchronous API calls, improved SSL verification, and robust environment variable handling.
- The server is configured to use `streamable-http` transport.
- The primary blocker for full testing and usability is the population of `FilterableFields` in `urls.json`.
- The server is ready for testing with the MCP Inspector. For HTTP transport testing, run `python ise_mcp.py` and connect the Inspector to the HTTP endpoint. For STDIO testing via `fastmcp dev`, use: `python -m fastmcp dev ise_mcp.py --with httpx --with pydantic --with python-dotenv`.

## Known Issues

- **Incomplete `FilterableFields`:** Same as previously noted.
- **URL Placeholders in `urls.json`:** Same as previously noted; path parameters in URLs are not currently supported by the dynamic tool generation logic.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

1.  **Initial State:** Custom JSON-RPC server.
2.  **Migration to `fastmcp`:** Core refactoring.
3.  **Addition of Filtering:** Generic filtering added.
4.  **Enhanced Docstrings:** To support filtering.
5.  **Configuration of Filterable Fields:** `urls.json` extended.
6.  **Debugging `fastmcp` Integration (Recent):**
    *   Addressed `TypeError` for `add_tool` by removing `input_schema`.
    *   Corrected `AttributeError` for `get_tools_mcp` to `await get_tools()`.
    *   Switched to `async def _main_async` and `await mcp.run_async()` to resolve event loop issues. Configured `streamable-http` transport.
    *   Set `mcp.dependencies = []` for `fastmcp dev` compatibility.
    *   Used `python -m fastmcp dev` to resolve CLI PATH issues.
    *   Refined tool function signatures to use an optional Pydantic model instance with `default_factory=InputModelType` for the `params` argument. This was crucial to fix `ValidationError` when tools were called from MCP Inspector without explicit arguments.
    *   Replaced `requests` with `httpx` for asynchronous API calls.
    *   Improved SSL verification handling and environment variable checks (including `sys.exit`).
    *   Adopted `pathlib` for loading `urls.json`.
