# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current task is to update all documentation (memory bank files, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`) to reflect the new Docker-based setup for running the ISE MCP server, particularly for integration with Claude Desktop.

## Recent Changes
- **Dockerfile Updated:** Modified to use `stdio` transport for compatibility with Claude Desktop and Docker Desktop AI Tools. The `COPY .env .` line was removed.
- **Docker Image Built:** A new Docker image `ise-mcp:latest` was built using the updated Dockerfile.
- **`docker-compose.yml` Updated:**
    - Removed `command` directive to avoid conflict with Dockerfile `ENTRYPOINT`.
    - Removed obsolete `version` attribute.
- **Claude Desktop Configuration (`claude_desktop_config.json`) Updated:**
    - Changed the "ISE_MCP" server command to use `docker run -i --rm --env-file=.env ise-mcp:latest`.
    - Set `cwd` to the project root.
- **`ISE_MCP.md` (Tool Definition for Docker Desktop AI Tools) Created & Updated:**
    - Created the initial markdown file.
    - Updated the image name to `ise-mcp:latest`.
- **`README.md` Updated:** The "Running the Server" section was significantly revised to detail the Docker-based setup for Claude Desktop.

## Next Steps
1.  Update `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` to document the Docker-based architecture and STDIO transport for Claude Desktop.
2.  Update `memory-bank/techContext.md` to reflect Docker usage, the `ise-mcp:latest` image, and the `docker run` command for Claude Desktop.
3.  Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to capture the successful transition to a Docker-based workflow for Claude Desktop.
4.  Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a new entry detailing the Dockerization changes and updated Claude Desktop configuration.
5.  Attempt completion of the overall task.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The primary method for running the ISE MCP server with Claude Desktop is now via `docker run` with STDIO transport, managed by the Claude Desktop configuration.
- The `.env` file is crucial and must be present in the project root for the `docker run --env-file` command to work, or for `fastmcp run` (used with `uv`) to auto-load it.
- The `docker-compose.yml` file is now secondary, mainly for local testing if not using Claude Desktop's direct Docker integration.
- An alternative local execution method using `uv --directory . run fastmcp run src/cisco/ISE/ise_mcp_server/server.py --transport stdio` has been documented for STDIO clients.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- The server uses `fastmcp` for MCP implementation.
- Configuration is split between `src/cisco/ISE/ise_mcp_server/urls.json` (for API endpoints and tool definitions) and `.env` (for credentials and SSL settings). The `.env` file is *not* part of the Docker image but is mounted/read at runtime.
- Tools are generated dynamically.
- Tool arguments are handled via an optional Pydantic model instance (`params`) using `default_factory`.
- Asynchronous operations are preferred for I/O bound tasks (like API calls).

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Maintaining synchronization between code and all forms of documentation (memory bank, README, CHANGELOG) is critical.
- The current version of `src/cisco/ISE/ise_mcp_server/server.py` is significantly more robust due to the adoption of `httpx`, better error handling, and improved configuration management.
