# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current task was to migrate the ISE MCP server to a more modular architecture, following best practices for software design. This has been completed, with the server now organized into logical modules with clear separation of concerns.

## Recent Changes
- **Modular Architecture Implemented:** The server has been reorganized into a proper Python package with separate modules for configuration, core functionality, API communication, and tool management.
- **Class-Based Design:** Replaced loose functions with explicit classes, including:
  - `ISEMCPServer`: Main server class that encapsulates server logic
  - `ToolFactory`: Factory class for creating tool functions
  - `ISEApiClient`: Client class for API communication
- **Package Structure:** Created a standard Python package structure with proper module organization:
  ```
  ise_mcp_server/
  ├── __init__.py
  ├── __main__.py          # Command-line entry point
  ├── server.py            # Main server class
  ├── config/              # Configuration-related modules
  │   ├── __init__.py
  │   ├── settings.py      # Environment variables and settings
  │   ├── urls.json        # URL definitions for the API endpoints
  │   └── urls_config.py   # Functions to load URL definitions
  ├── core/                # Core functionality
  │   ├── __init__.py
  │   ├── models.py        # Pydantic models for tool inputs
  │   └── utils.py         # Utility functions
  ├── api/                 # API client
  │   ├── __init__.py
  │   └── client.py        # ISE API client
  └── tools/               # Tool-related modules
      ├── __init__.py
      └── factory.py       # Tool factory
  ```
- **Dockerfile Updated:** Modified to install the entire package and use the new module structure.
- **setup.py Created:** Added to make the package installable and provide a console script entry point.
- **Command-Line Interface Added:** Added proper command-line argument parsing for host, port, and transport options.
- **Unit Tests Added:** Created basic tests and a verification script for the modular structure.

## Next Steps
1. Complete testing of the modular architecture with live Cisco ISE to verify functionality.
2. Implement further enhancements as outlined in the future roadmap, such as:
   - Adding caching mechanisms for API responses
   - Implementing rate limiting for API requests
   - Adding metrics collection
   - Extending the API client to support POST, PUT, DELETE operations

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The primary method for running the ISE MCP server with Claude Desktop is still via `docker run` with STDIO transport, but the Docker image now installs the entire package instead of just copying individual files.
- The `.env` file is still crucial and must be present in the project root for environment variables.
- The improved URL configuration loading now checks multiple file locations for backwards compatibility.
- The package can now be installed and run as a standard Python package using `pip install -e .` and the `ise-mcp-server` command.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Modular Design:** The server now follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns.
- **Explicit Factory Pattern:** Implemented a dedicated `ToolFactory` class to create tool functions.
- **Repository Pattern:** The `ISEApiClient` class encapsulates data access logic.
- **Configuration Object:** Centralized settings in a dedicated module.
- **Dependency Injection:** Factory and client instances are provided to the server.
- **CLI Arguments:** Command-line arguments for customization.
- **Python Package Conventions:** Standard package structure with setup.py and entry points.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Organizing code into logical modules with clear responsibilities greatly improves maintainability.
- Following standard Python package conventions makes the project more accessible to other developers.
- Using explicit design patterns (Factory, Repository, etc.) helps clarify the code's structure and intent.
- A proper CLI with argument parsing enhances usability.
- Making the package installable provides a better user experience.
- Thorough documentation is essential for complex modular architectures.
