# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus has been on debugging and refining the `ise_mcp` server after its migration to the `fastmcp` library. This involved addressing several runtime errors related to tool registration, asynchronous operations, CLI usage, and Pydantic validation when interacting with the MCP Inspector. The immediate next step is to complete this memory bank update.

## Recent Changes

- **`ise_mcp/main.py` extensively debugged and refactored:**
    - **Tool Registration:**
        - Resolved `TypeError` for `FastMCP.add_tool()` by removing the `input_schema` argument.
        - Tool functions are now defined to accept a single Pydantic model instance (e.g., `params: FilterableToolInput`) for their arguments.
        - This `params` argument is made optional using `pydantic.Field(default_factory=InputModelType)` to handle calls from clients (like MCP Inspector) that might not provide explicit arguments, resolving a `ValidationError: Missing required argument`.
    - **Asynchronous Operations:**
        - Corrected `AttributeError` for `mcp.get_tools_mcp()` by changing to `await mcp.get_tools()`.
        - The main execution block (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) was converted to run an `async def _main_async()` function using `asyncio.run()`.
        - Resolved an event loop conflict by changing `mcp.run()` to `await mcp.run_async()` within the `_main_async` function.
    - **FastMCP CLI Compatibility:**
        - Addressed a `TypeError` in `fastmcp dev` by explicitly setting `mcp.dependencies = []` on the server instance.
    - **Pydantic Models:** Re-introduced `FilterableToolInput` and `NonFilterableToolInput` to be used as type hints for the `params` argument in dynamically generated tool functions.
- **`ise_mcp/Dockerfile` updated:**
    - Modified to copy `requirements.txt` and install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` instead of individual `pip install` commands for each package.
- **Troubleshooting `fastmcp dev`:**
    - Addressed `zsh: command not found: fastmcp` by using `python -m fastmcp dev ...` to run the CLI as a module.
- **Memory Bank Update (Ongoing):** This update.

## Next Steps

1.  Complete the update of the remaining memory bank files:
    *   `systemPatterns.md`
    *   `techContext.md`
    *   `progress.md`
2.  **Crucial User Task:** The user/developer needs to thoroughly review and accurately populate the `FilterableFields` array for *every* endpoint in `ise_mcp/urls.json` by consulting the official Cisco ISE API documentation. This is essential for the generated tool docstrings to be accurate and helpful.
3.  Test the updated `ise_mcp` server using `python -m fastmcp dev ise_mcp/main.py --with requests --with pydantic --with python-dotenv` and the MCP Inspector to ensure tools are discoverable, callable (especially without arguments), and that filtering works as expected.
4.  Consider adding more specific Pydantic input models for tools if certain endpoints have well-defined, non-generic query parameters beyond basic filtering.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- **Tool Function Signatures:** The decision to use a single, optional Pydantic model instance (e.g., `params: FilterableToolInput = Field(default_factory=FilterableToolInput)`) as the argument for dynamically generated tools was made to ensure compatibility with FastMCP's schema inference and to gracefully handle calls from clients that might send empty argument lists.
- **Filterable Fields Accuracy:** Remains a critical dependency on user input.
- **Error Handling:** Current error handling is robust for API call issues.
- **`fastmcp dev` Usage:** Using `python -m fastmcp dev` is the current workaround for PATH issues with the `fastmcp` command.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- **Dynamic Tool Generation:** The core pattern is stable. The signature of generated functions has been refined.
- **`fastmcp` Usage:** Standard features are used. The interaction between Pydantic models as function arguments and FastMCP's schema generation is key.
- **Environment Variables:** Unchanged.
- **Docstring Generation:** Unchanged.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- **FastMCP Tool Signatures:** FastMCP infers tool schemas from function type hints. When dynamically creating tools, the signature must be carefully crafted. Using Pydantic models as type hints for arguments is a good practice. Making such model-based arguments optional with `default_factory` is crucial for compatibility with clients that might not send explicit arguments (like MCP Inspector when calling a tool with no parameters).
- **Asynchronous Context:** `FastMCP` methods like `get_tools()` can be asynchronous and require `await`. Server startup (`run_async`) also needs to be handled correctly within an async context.
- **CLI Tooling (`fastmcp dev`):**
    - The `fastmcp dev` command can have specific expectations, such as the server object having a `dependencies` attribute.
    - PATH issues can sometimes be resolved by running CLI tools as Python modules (`python -m <module>`).
- **Iterative Debugging:** Resolving the initial `TypeError` led to a cascade of other issues (`AttributeError`, event loop errors, Pydantic validation errors), highlighting the importance of step-by-step testing and debugging.
