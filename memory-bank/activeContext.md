# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current task is a full code review of `ise_mcp.py` and updating all associated documentation, including the memory bank files, `README.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Recent Changes
- **Code Review of `ise_mcp.py` Completed:**
    - Verified use of `httpx.AsyncClient` for asynchronous API calls.
    - Confirmed robust SSL verification logic (boolean true/false or CA bundle path).
    - Noted improved environment variable handling, including script exit on missing critical variables and assertions for `USERNAME`/`PASSWORD`.
    - Confirmed `pathlib` is used for loading `urls.json`.
    - Identified `streamable-http` as the configured transport in `_main_async`.
    - Reviewed error handling for `httpx` exceptions.
- **Read all memory bank files, `README.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`** to prepare for updates.

## Next Steps
1.  Update `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` to reflect findings from the code review (e.g., `httpx`, SSL handling, `sys.exit`).
2.  Update `memory-bank/techContext.md` (e.g., `httpx`, `streamable-http` transport).
3.  Update `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` and `memory-bank/productContext.md` if any core aspects changed (expected to be minor or none).
4.  Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect the current state and successful code review.
5.  Update `README.md` with any necessary changes based on the code review (e.g., mention of `httpx`, SSL options, `streamable-http` transport).
6.  Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a new entry detailing the changes identified and implemented in `ise_mcp.py`.
7.  Attempt completion of the overall task.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The updates to documentation will be based on the state of `ise_mcp.py` as of the latest review.
- The `CHANGELOG.md` will get a new version entry reflecting these updates.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- The server uses `fastmcp` for MCP implementation.
- Configuration is split between `ise_mcp/urls.json` (for API endpoints and tool definitions) and `ise_mcp/.env` (for credentials and SSL settings).
- Tools are generated dynamically.
- Tool arguments are handled via an optional Pydantic model instance (`params`) using `default_factory`.
- Asynchronous operations are preferred for I/O bound tasks (like API calls).

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Maintaining synchronization between code and all forms of documentation (memory bank, README, CHANGELOG) is critical.
- The current version of `ise_mcp.py` is significantly more robust due to the adoption of `httpx`, better error handling, and improved configuration management.
