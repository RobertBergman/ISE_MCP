# Project Brief

## Core Requirements and Goals

- To create a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides tools for interacting with a Cisco ISE (Identity Services Engine) instance.
- The server should dynamically generate tools based on a list of Cisco ISE API endpoints.
- Tools should allow for filtering of API results where supported by the Cisco ISE API.
- The server should be implemented using the `fastmcp` Python library.
- The server should follow best practices for software design, including modular architecture and separation of concerns.

## Project Scope

**In Scope:**
- Migration of an existing custom JSON-RPC ISE MCP server to use the `fastmcp` library.
- Dynamic generation of MCP tools from a `urls.json` configuration file.
- Implementation of filtering capabilities for the generated tools, allowing users to pass filter expressions and query parameters.
- Generation of informative docstrings for each tool, including guidance on filtering and available filterable fields.
- Use of `httpx.AsyncClient` for asynchronous API calls.
- Configuration of SSL verification for ISE API calls via environment variables.
- Server transport configurable via command-line arguments (default: `streamable-http`).
- Refactoring the codebase to a modular, well-organized package structure with clear separation of concerns.
- Implementation of a proper API client class to encapsulate API communication.
- Implementation of a dedicated tool factory for creating tool functions.
- Making the package installable with `setup.py` and providing a console script entry point.
- Adding basic unit tests and verification scripts.

**Completed Enhancements:**
- Reorganized the codebase into a modular structure with logical component separation.
- Implemented an explicit `ToolFactory` class to replace implicit factory function.
- Created a dedicated `ISEApiClient` class to encapsulate API communication.
- Centralized configuration in a settings module.
- Added proper command-line argument handling with `argparse`.
- Made the package installable via `setup.py`.
- Added a console script entry point for easier command-line usage.
- Enhanced URL configuration loading to support multiple file locations.
- Added unit tests for core functionality.
- Created an import verification script to validate the modular structure.
- Updated the Docker configuration to install the package properly.
- Added comprehensive documentation for each module.

**Out of Scope:**
- Comprehensive research and population of all possible filterable fields for every Cisco ISE API endpoint (this requires external documentation lookup by the user/developer).
- Implementation of Cisco ISE API endpoints beyond GET requests (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Advanced error handling or retry logic beyond what `httpx` and `fastmcp` provide by default.
- User authentication/authorization for the MCP server itself (relies on Cisco ISE credentials for API calls).
- Implementation of caching mechanisms for API responses.
- Implementation of rate limiting for API requests.
- Comprehensive test coverage for all edge cases.
- Integration with monitoring systems.

## Key Stakeholders

- Developers or users who need to interact with Cisco ISE programmatically via an MCP interface.
- Cline (myself), for maintaining and extending this server.
- Future developers who will need to understand and modify the codebase.

## Success Metrics

- The MCP server successfully connects to and interacts with the Cisco ISE API.
- All tools defined in `urls.json` are correctly registered and discoverable.
- Tools can be called with and without filter parameters, and the API calls reflect these parameters.
- Docstrings for tools provide clear instructions on usage and filtering.
- The server operates reliably using the `fastmcp` library.
- The modular architecture makes the codebase more maintainable and extensible.
- New developers can easily understand the codebase structure and components.
- The package can be installed and run using standard Python tooling.
- Unit tests pass successfully.

## Future Roadmap

Potential enhancements for future iterations:
- Add caching mechanisms for API responses to improve performance.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent overwhelming the ISE API.
- Add metrics collection for monitoring purposes.
- Enhance error handling with retry logic for transient failures.
- Extend the API client to support POST, PUT, and DELETE operations.
- Add more comprehensive test coverage.
- Create a CLI configuration file for persistent settings.
- Implement a plugin system for custom tool extensions.
